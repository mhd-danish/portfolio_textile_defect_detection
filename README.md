# Textile Defect Detection: Classification

In the context of textile fabric, rare anomalies can occur, hence compromizing the overall quality. In order to avoid that, it is crucial to detect these rare defects.

Textile Defect Detection is a binary classification project which is able to predict whether the given patch of the fabric is damaged or not (good).
